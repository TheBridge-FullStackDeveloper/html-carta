 <h1>Re: Eileen Dover university application
</h1>  
<p>Dear Eileen,</p>
<p>Thank you for your recent application to join us at the University of Awesome's science faculty to study as part of your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> next year. I will answer your questions one by one, in the following sections.</p> 
<h2>Starting dates</h2>
<p>We are happy to accommodate you starting your study with us at any time, however it would suit us better if you could start at the beginning of a semester; the start dates for each one are as follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
    <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
    <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>
<p>Please let me know if this is ok, and if so which start date you would prefer.</p>
<p>You can find more information about important university dates on our website.</p>
